# AI Image Data Poisoning

AI Image Data Poisoning is a Python script that demonstrates how to add imperceptible perturbations to images, known as adversarial noise, which can disrupt the training process of AI models. This technique aims to protect artists' images by introducing subtle modifications that hinder the performance of AI algorithms without significantly altering the appearance of the images to human observers.


## Overview

As AI algorithms become increasingly prevalent in analyzing and generating images, there is a growing concern about the potential misuse or misinterpretation of visual content. AI Image Data Poisoning provides a defense mechanism against unauthorized use or exploitation of artists' images by introducing imperceptible perturbations that disrupt the training process of AI models.


## Purpose

The purpose of AI Image Data Poisoning is to protect artists' images from unauthorized use or manipulation by AI algorithms. By adding imperceptible noise to the images, the script aims to hinder the performance of AI models trained on these images, thereby deterring potential misuse or misinterpretation of the visual content.


## Concept

The concept behind AI Image Data Poisoning is to leverage adversarial noise, a form of imperceptible perturbations, to disrupt the training process of AI models without significantly altering the appearance of the images to human observers. By adding subtle modifications to the images, the script aims to introduce ambiguity and uncertainty into the training data, making it more challenging for AI algorithms to accurately learn and generalize from the images.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnthenaMatrix/ai-image-data-poisoning.git


2. **Run the Script:**
python inject.py


3. **Follow the Instructions:**
Define the path to the original image file within the script.

Adjust the epsilon value to control the magnitude of the adversarial noise.

Run the script to add noise to the image and save the poisoned image.
